The WPM manufacturer shall be affiliated with an inspection agency accredited by the board of review of the American Lumber Standard Committee. The WPM manufacturer shall ensure traceability to the original source of heat treatment. Each piece of WPM shall be marked to show the conformance to the International Plant Protection Convention Standard. Certification markings shall be indelible and permanent. They may be stamped, stenciled, or branded directly onto or into the WPM. Certification marks shall be applied in a visible location on at least two opposite sides of the wood packaging product but are not required on each individual component piece of a wood packaging product. On dunnage, the marking shall be applied every 2 feet to opposite surfaces of each piece. If possible, the mark shall be visible when the dunnage is placed in the load to enable inspectors to verify the WPM’s compliance without unloading or unstuffing the container. Foreign manufacturers shall have the heat treatment of WPM verified in accordance with their National Plant Protection Organization’s compliance program.</para>

Tailoring of the packaging instructions may only be authorized by the packaging requirements developer. If tailored, prototype package is required to validate the sizes and fit requirements. Minor dimensional and size changes are acceptable provided email notification is provided to the packaging requirements developer. Any design changes or changes in the method of preservation that provide a cost savings without degrading the method of preservation or packing or affecting the serviceability of the item will be considered and responded to within 10 days of submission.
