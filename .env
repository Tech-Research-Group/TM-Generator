This is done so a single WP can be removed from the paper TM if needed for a task. Blank pages are inserted as needed to ensure an even number of pages for each WP. Blank pages are assigned a number, but it does not appear in the TM. For example, if page 0001-10 of a WP is blank, page 0001-9 will have the number 0001-9/blank; or if page 0001-1 of a WP is blank, page 0001-2 will have the number 0001-blank/2."

WCN="Warning, caution, and note headings, chapter titles, and paragraph headings are printed in bold type. Warning icons may be included below the warning heading. Multiple warning, caution, or note paragraphs, if necessary, will appear below one warning, caution, or note heading. Prior to starting a WP, all warnings included in the WP should be reviewed, understood, and followed. Review the materials/parts in the initial setup of the WP for any hazardous materials used during maintenance of the equipment. Then refer to the detailed warnings for hazardous materials in the Warning Summary. Make sure to read all warnings within referenced WP that are required to complete tasks."

# GENERAL INFO
CPCDATA="<item>UNIFORM (or general attack): Affects a large area of exposed metal surface, like rust on steel or tarnish on silver. It gradually reduces the thickness of the metal until it fails.</item>
            <item>CREVICE: Occurs in crevices created by rubber seals, gaskets, bolt heads, lap joints, dirt or other surface deposits. It will develop anywhere moisture or other corrosive agents are trapped and unable to drain or evaporate.</item>
            <item>SELECTIVE LEACHING: One element, usually the anodic element of an alloy, corrodes away, leaving the cathodic element. This can create holes in metal.</item>
            <item>INTERGRANULAR: Metal deterioration caused by corrosion on the bonds between or across the grain boundaries of the metal. The metal will appear to be peeling off in sheets, flaking, or being pushed apart by layers. A particular type of intergranular corrosion is exfoliation.</item>
            <item>PITTING: This can result from conditions similar to those for crevice corrosion. Pits can develop on various materials due to their composition. Weapon boxes are big victims of pitting.</item>
            <item>EROSION: Results when a moving fluid (liquid or gas) flows across a metal surface, particularly when solid particles are present in the fluid. Corrosion actually occurs on the surface of the metal, but the moving fluid washes away the corrosion and exposes a new metal surface, which also corrodes.</item>
            <item>FRETTING: Occurs as a result of small, repetitive movements (e.g., vibration) between two surfaces in contact with each other. It's usually identified by a black powder corrosion product or pits on the surface.</item>
            <item>GALVANIC: Occurs when two different types of metal come in contact with each other, like steel bolts on aluminum, for example. This is a common problem on aircraft because of their mix of metals.</item>
            <item>STRESS: Term used to describe corrosion cracking and corrosion fatigue.</item>"

# SITING SECTION
SITING_INTRO="This section outlines technical considerations applicable to deployment of ${SYSTEM_NAME} (${SYSTEM_ACRONYM}) into a designated region. Refer to ATP 4-45, Force Provider Operations for additional planning guidance. Although each deployment will involve a particular set of tasks reflecting unique tactical, climatic, and other considerations, the following preparatory tasks are typical in identifying and preparing a site to accommodate an ${SYSTEM_ACRONYM}:"
SITING_C_P1="Site Selection. Within area of possible locations, determine sites of suitable size and characteristics to accommodate an ${SYSTEM_ACRONYM}. Initially identified sites are then more closely evaluated, and the best choices are ranked in ordered for final selection."
SITING_C_P2="Site Planning. Customize ${SYSTEM_ACRONYM} layout to minimize effort and maximize use of existing conditions and facilities at proposed site. Specific requirements for ${SYSTEM_ACRONYM} mission must be considered. Estimate required site work, and devise transport and deployment schedules. If site planning problems are encountered, or unanticipated site preparation tasks become necessary, a site may be dropped and next-best site selected. Planning phase will culminate in a comprehensive site plan and task list."
SITING_C_P3="Site Preparation. Execute site preparation activities as determined during planning phase. These may include land clearing, road construction, grading and emplacement of culverts, berms, drainage improvement, and construction of concrete slabs."
SITING_C_P4="Staking and Staging. Using diagrams provided in this WP, modified to suit local conditions, designate locations of components, shelters, equipment, and support containers with stakes on prepared site IAW instructions in this TM. Proposed layout in this WP is a recommended setup based on anticipated requirements. Deviations or alterations are permitted."
SITING_R_INTRO="Area required for one ${SYSTEM_ACRONYM} takes up 18,750 ft² (1,742 m²) (150 ft x 125 ft; (45.7 m x 38.1 m)); additional space may be needed depending on supply/storage considerations and sewage disposal methods. Look for following characteristics when selecting a potential ${SYSTEM_ACRONYM} site:"
SITING_R_P1="Select a relatively level area. Ground does not have to be flat, but level ground will make setup easier. Maximum recommended slope is four degrees. There should be no more than a 7-ft rise or drop in grade over 100 ft (30.5 m)."
SITING_R_P2="Only minimal grading, brush, rock, or tree removal should be required. Blasting or large rock removal should be avoided if possible."
SITING_R_P3="Avoid low points in valleys or other depressed areas, as they are susceptible to water collection."
SITING_R_P4="Avoid areas of high water tables."
SITING_R_P5="Ensure there is sufficient space (150 ft x 125 ft (45.7 m x 38.1 m)) to deploy ${SYSTEM_ACRONYM}."
SITING_R_P6="Consider latitude and longitude and orientation of ${SYSTEM_ACRONYM} components to minimize effects of shadows, solar radiation, and prevailing winds. If possible, area should be sheltered from high winds."
SITING_R_P7="If necessary, dig a drainage ditch around area to provide adequate drainage."
SITING_R_P8="Proximity to potential water sources and waste disposal facilities."
SITING_R_P9="Proximity to supported units, lines of communication, and supply facilities."
SITING_R_P10="Access to an external supply road. Additional space requirements for internal roads to facilitate frequent delivery of water, rations, or removal of trash and wastewater may be required. Vehicular access will also be required for emergency response vehicles. In addition, consider need for sufficient space for snow removal equipment."

# ASSEMBLY AND PREP FOR USE SECTION
PREP_FOR_USE_INTRO_P1="Assembly and preparation for use of each subsystem in the ${SYSTEM_NAME_FULL} is performed in one or more work packages. This work package serves as a reference guide for setting up the ${SYSTEM_ACRONYM}. The order listed in this WP maximizes the ability of material handling equipment (MHE) to move heavy items, and minimizes MHE interaction with personnel assembling each subsystem. Setup order may be modified based on mission requirement and multiple subsystems may be set up at the same time if enough personnel are available. Refer to Figure 1 for guidance on laying out the ${SYS_ACRONYM} site."
PREP_FOR_USE_INTRO_P2="The transportation and storage containers should be set up first, if logistically possible, in all configurations to allow for setup and support items to be obtained as they are required during assembly of each subsystem. Once the containers are in position, the priority of each subsystem may be left to the discretion of the unit commander. When modifying setup order, ensure all safety measures are followed."
