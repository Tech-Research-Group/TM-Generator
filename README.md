# TM-Generator

TM Generator is a Windows desktop application that creates various technical manual shells based on MIL-STD-40051-[2B](http://everyspec.com/MIL-STD/MIL-STD-10000-and-Up/MIL-STD-40051_2B_44811/), [2C](http://everyspec.com/MIL-STD/MIL-STD-10000-and-Up/MIL-STD-40051-2C_53570/) and 2D requirements.

### HOW TO
The generator requires having a prebuilt TM tracker Excel file in order to work. Fill in all the required fields, select your manual type, MIL-STD and optional chapters (if needed), then use the "Select Tracker" button to select the appropriate tracker needed to create the tech manual. Once that is done, click the "Build TM" button to  choose a location to save your newly generated TM. The program outputs a folder with all the required XML files needed to publish a technical manual in PDF format in  [*ArborText*](https://www.ptc.com/en/products/arbortext).

There are example TM trackers in the trackers folder that you can use to help you create your tracker. Please use the chapter titles that are used in the tracker examples. The program needs those names to be correct in order to work properly. If something is not working, check to make sure you don't have any typos in your chapter headings.

### OPTIONAL CHAPTERS
Currently, the only optional chapters that work are the Troubleshooting Master Index and the Destruction of Equipment chapters. More chapters will be added in future updates.
