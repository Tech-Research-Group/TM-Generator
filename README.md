# TM-Generator

TM Generator is a Windows desktop application that creates various technical manual shells based on MIL-STD-40051-[2B](http://everyspec.com/MIL-STD/MIL-STD-10000-and-Up/MIL-STD-40051_2B_44811/), [2C](http://everyspec.com/MIL-STD/MIL-STD-10000-and-Up/MIL-STD-40051-2C_53570/) and 2D requirements.

### HOW TO
The generator requires having a prebuilt TM tracker Excel file in order to work. Fill in all the required fields, select your manual type, MIL-STD and optional chapters (if needed), then use the "Select Tracker" button to select the appropriate tracker needed to create the tech manual. Once that is done, click the "Build TM" button to  choose a location to save your newly generated TM. The program outputs a folder with all the required XML files needed to publish a technical manual in PDF format in  [*ArborText*](https://www.ptc.com/en/products/arbortext).
